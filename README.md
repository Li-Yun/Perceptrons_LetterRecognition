# Perceptrons_LetterRecognition

This program implmented a simple letter-recognition classifier using Perceptron classifiers. <br />
Basically, the perceptron takes 16 elements as a feature of letters and feeds all training instances <br />
into the perceptron to train the perceptron classifier. When training the perceptrons, I applied a all-pair <br />
approach to acheive a multi-class recognntion task. <br />
